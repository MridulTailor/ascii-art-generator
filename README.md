## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Image Processing**: When you upload an image, the application uses the HTML5 Canvas API to efficiently resize and analyze its pixel data.
2.  **Brightness Mapping**: Each pixel's brightness is meticulously mapped to a corresponding ASCII character from a predefined set (e.g., `@%#*+=-:. `), creating a visual representation of the image using text characters.
3.  **Real-time Updates**: Any adjustments you make to the settings ‚Äî like width, font size, brightness, or character set ‚Äî instantly regenerate the ASCII art, allowing for immediate visual feedback.
4.  **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: The converter intelligently maintains the original image's aspect ratio, ensuring that your ASCII art maintains proper proportions, aided by character height/width compensation.
